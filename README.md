"Invest Buddy"

Coherent and reliable financial information eliminates the need for investment advisors. A basic GUI was developed as the first step towards achieving this goal targeting the young population who are willing to take calculated risks to achieve one’s personal money goals but lack the necessary fiscal knowledge.

Out of the various Invest methods known to us, we have considered the below:

* Bank
* Stocks
* Cryptos
* Bonds
* ETF
* P2P

Tools used:

* Java
* Eclipse
* Gradle

Features:

* Defined user input fields for amount and period of investment within given ranges of 0 to 2000000 euros and 0 to 100 years respectively.
* Dynamic calculation of ROI for the chosen Investment method.
* Calculates the risk of retaining the money without investment.
* Link to the websites of the sponsoring Companies

For the ROI calculations, the potential data are extracted from public domain like statistica and Inflation data from world bank website. But an unanswered question to us is how to capture the fast-changing market volatility. 

This project was developed using the JSwing component of Java and later run using gradle. 

As we are new to programming and this is one of the first projects we have developed, it is a simple user-friendly GUI with huge scope for improvement.
